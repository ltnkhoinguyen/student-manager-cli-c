# Student Manager CLI (C)

A simple command-line application for managing student records, written in C using structs, arrays, and pointers.
## How to Run

### Compile
```bash
gcc StudentManagerCLI.c -o app
```
## Features
- Add student
- Display student list
- Delete student by ID (MSSV)
- Find student by ID (MSSV)
- Sort students by GPA using `qsort`

## Technologies
- C programming language
- Structs
- Arrays
- Pointers
- Standard libraries (`stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`, `string.h`)

## Learning Goals
This project was built to practice:
- Working with structs and arrays
- Using pointers effectively
- Handling input
- Sorting data
- Writing modular and readable C code

## Future Improvements
- Save and load data from file
- Use dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`, `free`)
- Improve CLI interface
- Improve code structure and readability
